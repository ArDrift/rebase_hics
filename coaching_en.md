## __What is coaching?__

Coaching is an interaction between the coach and the client, during which the
client uses his own power resources to start thinking along a new pattern. This
helps him to develop his competences, his decision-making mechanism reaches a
new plane and his life quality develops. The meeting is led by the coach, whose
task is to accompany his client, support his development and growing efficiency.
Coaching can be a one-on-one meeting, a group session or leadership coaching.

__Life coaching__

The fundamental value for a life and business coach is the human being. The most
important part of the meeting is the client; all attention is on him and his
professional or private stall, and the aim is to find the best possible solution for the
problem. Our main focus is that the client brings out the best in him, deepens his
self-awareness; he becomes aware of his strengths and he is able to use them in his
every-day life to feel more complete. Our meetings are solution focussed.

Fields:

- private conflicts and stalls

- value crisis

- pathfinding, reflection

- Conflicts at the working place

- Self-awareness development

- The experience of loss

- Career decisions

- Choice and change of career

__Coaching for Leaders__

(for leaders, managers and business owners)

We are several times challenged and face situations in our business life that
require our external and internal power resources to find effective and applicable
solutions for the problem; and to have the ability to recognize and step over a
milestone. We look for solutions that are coherent with the operational mechanism
of the firm and our own condition and attitudes. Solutions that make us feel good
and we are able to go on with feeling successful and balanced.

Fields:

- Stress

- Burnout

- Delegation

- Assertiveness

- Decision

- Time management

- Career

- Network

- Conflict management

- Motivation

- Self-awareness

- Relations/Partners

- Personal brand

__Team coaching__

This type of coaching focusses on groups. Every organization (where there are
more than 2 employees) is a team. Every team has different dynamics and
mechanisms. A team that operates badly can block whole organizational processes;
meanwhile a well-functioning team can create great additional value. In this case
2+2=5 can stand. With the right expert, the efficiency of the team can be multiplied,
the inhibitory factors within the team can be dissolved so that the positive

synergies prevail. Coaching supports the successful teamwork with a wide variety
of tools.

Fields:

- Effective cooperation

- Communication

- Conflict management

- Process management

- Motivation

- Network development

- Special development of professional groups (financial, human resource
economy, etc.)

- The integration of new methods and solutions

Coaching for leaders of non-profit organizations
(Middle-level leaders, managers)

As in business coaching, the leaders of non-profit organizations are several times
challenged and face situations in their business lives that require their external
and internal power sources to find effective and applicable solutions for the
problem; and to have the ability to recognize and step over a milestone. We help to
look for solutions that are coherent with the operational mechanism of the firm
and their own condition and attitudes. Solutions that make them feel good and
they are able to go on with feeling successful and balanced.
